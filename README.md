eRegulations Documentation
============

[eRegulations](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/) is a web-based tool that makes regulations easier to find, read and understand with features such as inline official interpretations, highlighted defined terms, and a revision comparison view. This repository contains documentation for the project and can be viewed at <http://cfpb.github.io/eRegulations>.

```
gem install jekyll
gem install kramdown
```

Fork and clone the repo:

```
Run Jekyll:

```
